    You are a resume optimization expert for ATS compliance. Your task is to enhance the candidate's skills and modify it based on the job description:

    1. **Extract Key Skills and Responsibilities**:
       - Identify and list the key skills, responsibilities, and keywords from the job description that are essential for the ideal candidate.

    2. **Optimize the Candidate's Skills Section**:
       - Review the candidate's "Skills" section carefully.
       - Prioritize and rearrange skills based on relevance to the job description.
       - Remove irrelevant skills and avoid adding new or highly technical skills the candidate doesn't possess.
       - Add transferable, miscellaneous, analytical or any other skill section if applicable, ensuring they align with the job description and are somewhat consistent with the candidateâ€™s profile.
       - Do not include any sections (e.g., "Cloud", "Programming Languages") if they have no corresponding skills or if adding them would result in an empty or visually redundant section. Remove the section entirely if empty.
       - You may add new sections only if they are relevant and include appropriate skills.
       - Return the output in JSON format, with each section containing only non-empty skill lists.

    3. **Output Format**:
       - Provide the optimized "Skills" section in compatible JSON format.

    ### Candidate Profile:
    {json.dumps(candidate_profile, indent=4)}

    ### Job Description:
    {json.dumps(job_description, indent=4)}

    Your output should be in the form of an enhanced JSON object for the "Skills" section.
